# Parking-Lot-Vacancy-Detector
Cascade classifiers were trained for detecting cars using LBP and Haar features. <br />
2300 positive and 6100 negative samples were used for training. <br />
<br />
**Haar Cascade 15 stages.xml, Haar Cascade 19 stages.xml, LBP Cascade 15 stages.xml and LBP Cascade 21 stages.xml** are the trained cascade classifier files. <br />
<br />
**Detection using classifier.cpp** is used to detect cars in the image, compare with ground truth and find number of parking locations. <br />
<br />
**Img1.jpg, Img2.jpg, Img3.jpg, Img4.jpg, Img5.jpg** are test images.
